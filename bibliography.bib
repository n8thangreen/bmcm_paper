abstract = {Survival analysis is one of the most important fields of statistics in medicine and the biological sciences. In addition, the computational advances in the last decades have favoured the use of Bayesian methods in this context, providing a flexible and powerful alternative to the traditional frequentist approach. The objective of this paper is to summarise some of the most popular Bayesian survival models, such as accelerated failure time, proportional hazards, mixture cure, competing risks, frailty, and joint models of longitudinal and survival data. Moreover, an implementation of each presented model is provided using a BUGS syntax that can be run with JAGS from the R programming language. Reference to other Bayesian R-packages are also discussed.},

abstract = {When analyzing time-to-event data, it often happens that a certain fraction of the data corresponds to subjects who will never experience the event of interest. These event times are considered as infinite and the subjects are said to be cured. Survival models that take this feature into account are commonly referred to as cure models. This article reviews the literature on cure regression models in which the event time (response) is subject to random right censoring and has a positive probability to be equal to infinity.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with survival extrapolation that represents an integral part of cost-effectiveness analysis. In the absence of long-term survival estimates from randomized clinical trials or meta-analysis we show how age-sex matched U.K. population data can additionally be used to estimate survival patterns. We adopt a Bayesian approach and we synthesize evidence from different sources such as patient registries, U.K. population statistics and meta-analyses. We also present methodology for Bayesian analysis of the additive hazards model and we show how to apply the techniques using freely available software. The methods are illustrated using data from a cohort of cardiac arrhythmia patients.},

@article{Jackson2010,
abstract = {Health economic decision models compare costs and health effects of different interventions over the long term and usually incorporate survival data. Since survival is often extrapolated beyond the range of the data, inaccurate model specification can result in very different policy decisions. However, in this area, flexible survival models are rarely considered, and model uncertainty is rarely accounted for. In this article, various survival distributions are applied in a decision model for oral cancer screening. Flexible parametric models are compared with Bayesian semiparametric models, in which the baseline hazard can be made arbitrarily complex while still enabling survival to be extrapolated. A fully Bayesian framework is used for all models so that uncertainties can be easily incorporated in estimates of long-term costs and effects. The fit and predictive ability of both parametric and semiparametric models are compared using the deviance information criterion in order to account for model uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Under the Bayesian semiparametric models, some smoothing of the hazard function is required to obtain adequate predictive ability and avoid sensitivity to the choice of prior. We determine that one flexible parametric survival model fits substantially better than the others considered in the oral cancer example.},

@article{Tawiah2020,
abstract = {Many medical studies yield data on recurrent clinical events from populations which consist of a proportion of cured patients in the presence of those who experience the event at several times (uncured). A frailty mixture cure model has recently been postulated for such data, with an assumption that the random subject effect (frailty) of each uncured patient is constant across successive gap times between recurrent events. We propose two new models in a more general setting, assuming a multivariate time-varying frailty with an AR(1) correlation structure for each uncured patient and addressing multilevel recurrent event data originated from multi-institutional (multi-centre) clinical trials, using extra random effect terms to adjust for institution effect and treatment-by-institution interaction. To solve the difficulties in parameter estimation due to these highly complex correlation structures, we develop an efficient estimation procedure via an EM-type algorithm based on residual maximum likelihood (REML) through the generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology. Simulation studies are presented to assess the performances of the models. Data sets from a colorectal cancer study and rhDNase multi-institutional clinical trial were analyzed to exemplify the proposed models. The results demonstrate a large positive AR(1) correlation among frailties across successive gap times, indicating a constant frailty may not be realistic in some situations. Comparisons of findings with existing frailty models are discussed.},

abstract = {This research mainly aims to develop a generalized cure rate model, estimate the proportion of cured patients and their survival rate, and identify the risk factors associated with infectious diseases. The generalized cure rate model is based on bounded cumulative hazard function, which is a non-mixture model, and is developed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution, to estimate the cure rate using maximum likelihood method and real data with R and STATA software. The results showed that the cure rate of tuberculosis (TB) patients was 26.3\%, which was higher than that of TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 23.1\%). The non-parametric median survival time of TB patients was 51 months, while that of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 33 months. Moreover, no risk factors were associated with TB patients co-infected with HIV, while age was a significant risk factor for TB patients among the suspected risk factors considered. Furthermore, the bounded cumulative hazard function was extended to accommodate infectious diseases with co-infections by deriving an appropriate probability density function, determining the distribution, and using real data. Governments and related health authorities are also encouraged to take appropriate actions to combat infectious diseases with possible co-infections.},

abstract = {This paper extends the multilevel survival model by allowing the existence of cured fraction in the model. Random effects induced by the multilevel clustering structure are specified in the linear predictors in both hazard function and cured probability parts. Adopting the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach to formulate the problem, parameter esti-mation is achieved by maximizing a best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) type log-likelihood at the initial step of estimation, and is then extended to obtain residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimators of the variance component. The proposed multilevel mixture cure model is applied to analyze the (i) child survival study data with multilevel clustering and (ii) chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) data on recurrent infections as illustrations. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the REML estimators and assess the accuracy of the standard error estimates. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
