@article{Alvares2020,
abstract = {Survival analysis is one of the most important fields of statistics in medicine and the biological sciences. In addition, the computational advances in the last decades have favoured the use of Bayesian methods in this context, providing a flexible and powerful alternative to the traditional frequentist approach. The objective of this paper is to summarise some of the most popular Bayesian survival models, such as accelerated failure time, proportional hazards, mixture cure, competing risks, frailty, and joint models of longitudinal and survival data. Moreover, an implementation of each presented model is provided using a BUGS syntax that can be run with JAGS from the R programming language. Reference to other Bayesian R-packages are also discussed.},

@article{Amico2018,
abstract = {When analyzing time-to-event data, it often happens that a certain fraction of the data corresponds to subjects who will never experience the event of interest. These event times are considered as infinite and the subjects are said to be cured. Survival models that take this feature into account are commonly referred to as cure models. This article reviews the literature on cure regression models in which the event time (response) is subject to random right censoring and has a positive probability to be equal to infinity.},

@article{Demiris2006,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with survival extrapolation that represents an integral part of cost-effectiveness analysis. In the absence of long-term survival estimates from randomized clinical trials or meta-analysis we show how age-sex matched U.K. population data can additionally be used to estimate survival patterns. We adopt a Bayesian approach and we synthesize evidence from different sources such as patient registries, U.K. population statistics and meta-analyses. We also present methodology for Bayesian analysis of the additive hazards model and we show how to apply the techniques using freely available software. The methods are illustrated using data from a cohort of cardiac arrhythmia patients.},

@article{Jackson2010,
abstract = {Health economic decision models compare costs and health effects of different interventions over the long term and usually incorporate survival data. Since survival is often extrapolated beyond the range of the data, inaccurate model specification can result in very different policy decisions. However, in this area, flexible survival models are rarely considered, and model uncertainty is rarely accounted for. In this article, various survival distributions are applied in a decision model for oral cancer screening. Flexible parametric models are compared with Bayesian semiparametric models, in which the baseline hazard can be made arbitrarily complex while still enabling survival to be extrapolated. A fully Bayesian framework is used for all models so that uncertainties can be easily incorporated in estimates of long-term costs and effects. The fit and predictive ability of both parametric and semiparametric models are compared using the deviance information criterion in order to account for model uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Under the Bayesian semiparametric models, some smoothing of the hazard function is required to obtain adequate predictive ability and avoid sensitivity to the choice of prior. We determine that one flexible parametric survival model fits substantially better than the others considered in the oral cancer example.},
