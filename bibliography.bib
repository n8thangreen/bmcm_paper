abstract = {Survival analysis is one of the most important fields of statistics in medicine and the biological sciences. In addition, the computational advances in the last decades have favoured the use of Bayesian methods in this context, providing a flexible and powerful alternative to the traditional frequentist approach. The objective of this paper is to summarise some of the most popular Bayesian survival models, such as accelerated failure time, proportional hazards, mixture cure, competing risks, frailty, and joint models of longitudinal and survival data. Moreover, an implementation of each presented model is provided using a BUGS syntax that can be run with JAGS from the R programming language. Reference to other Bayesian R-packages are also discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone resulted in longer progression-free and overall survival than ipilimumab alone in a trial involving patients with advanced melanoma. We now report 5-year outcomes in the trial. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma to receive one of the following regimens: nivolumab (at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks); nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab-matched placebo; or ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses) plus nivolumab-matched placebo. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, as compared with the ipilimumab group. RESULTS At a minimum follow-up of 60 months, the median overall survival was more than 60.0 months (median not reached) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 36.9 months in the nivolumab group, as compared with 19.9 months in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.52; hazard ratio for death with nivolumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.63). Overall survival at 5 years was 52% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 44% in the nivolumab group, as compared with 26% in the ipilimumab group. No sustained deterioration of health-related quality of life was observed during or after treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolumab alone. No new late toxic effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with advanced melanoma, sustained long-term overall survival at 5 years was observed in a greater percentage of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone than in those who received ipilimumab alone, with no apparent loss of quality of life in the patients who received regimens containing nivolumab.

abstract = {Health economic decision models compare costs and health effects of different interventions over the long term and usually incorporate survival data. Since survival is often extrapolated beyond the range of the data, inaccurate model specification can result in very different policy decisions. However, in this area, flexible survival models are rarely considered, and model uncertainty is rarely accounted for. In this article, various survival distributions are applied in a decision model for oral cancer screening. Flexible parametric models are compared with Bayesian semiparametric models, in which the baseline hazard can be made arbitrarily complex while still enabling survival to be extrapolated. A fully Bayesian framework is used for all models so that uncertainties can be easily incorporated in estimates of long-term costs and effects. The fit and predictive ability of both parametric and semiparametric models are compared using the deviance information criterion in order to account for model uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Under the Bayesian semiparametric models, some smoothing of the hazard function is required to obtain adequate predictive ability and avoid sensitivity to the choice of prior. We determine that one flexible parametric survival model fits substantially better than the others considered in the oral cancer example.},

abstract = {Many medical studies yield data on recurrent clinical events from populations which consist of a proportion of cured patients in the presence of those who experience the event at several times (uncured). A frailty mixture cure model has recently been postulated for such data, with an assumption that the random subject effect (frailty) of each uncured patient is constant across successive gap times between recurrent events. We propose two new models in a more general setting, assuming a multivariate time-varying frailty with an AR(1) correlation structure for each uncured patient and addressing multilevel recurrent event data originated from multi-institutional (multi-centre) clinical trials, using extra random effect terms to adjust for institution effect and treatment-by-institution interaction. To solve the difficulties in parameter estimation due to these highly complex correlation structures, we develop an efficient estimation procedure via an EM-type algorithm based on residual maximum likelihood (REML) through the generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology. Simulation studies are presented to assess the performances of the models. Data sets from a colorectal cancer study and rhDNase multi-institutional clinical trial were analyzed to exemplify the proposed models. The results demonstrate a large positive AR(1) correlation among frailties across successive gap times, indicating a constant frailty may not be realistic in some situations. Comparisons of findings with existing frailty models are discussed.},

The generalized cure rate model is based on bounded cumulative hazard function, which is a non-mixture model, and is developed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution, to estimate the cure rate using maximum likelihood method and real data with R and STATA software. The results showed that the cure rate of tuberculosis (TB) patients was 26.3\%, which was higher than that of TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 23.1\%). The non-parametric median survival time of TB patients was 51 months, while that of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 33 months. Moreover, no risk factors were associated with TB patients co-infected with HIV, while age was a significant risk factor for TB patients among the suspected risk factors considered. Furthermore, the bounded cumulative hazard function was extended to accommodate infectious diseases with co-infections by deriving an appropriate probability density function, determining the distribution, and using real data. Governments and related health authorities are also encouraged to take appropriate actions to combat infectious diseases with possible co-infections.},

abstract = {Clinical trials with multiple strata are increasingly used in drug development. They may sometimes be the only option to study a new treatment, for example in small populations and rare diseases. In early phase trials, where data are often sparse, good statistical inference and subsequent decision-making can be challenging. Inferences from simple pooling or stratification are known to be inferior to hierarchical modeling methods, which build on exchangeable strata parameters and allow borrowing information across strata. However, the standard exchangeability (EX) assumption bears the risk of too much shrinkage and excessive borrowing for extreme strata. We propose the exchangeability-nonexchangeability (EXNEX) approach as a robust mixture extension of the standard EX approach. It allows each stratum-specific parameter to be exchangeable with other similar strata parameters or nonexchangeable with any of them. While EXNEX computations can be performed easily with standard Bayesian software, model specifications and prior distributions are more demanding and require a good understanding of the context. Two case studies from phases I and II (with three and four strata) show promising results for EXNEX. Data scenarios reveal tempered degrees of borrowing for extreme strata, and frequentist operating characteristics perform well for estimation (bias, mean-squared error) and testing (less type-I error inflation).},

abstract = {Surrogate endpoints play an important role in drug development when they can be used to measure treatment effect early compared to the final clinical outcome and to predict clinical benefit or harm. Such endpoints are assessed for their predictive value of clinical benefit by investigating the surrogate relationship between treatment effects on the surrogate and final outcomes using meta-analytic methods. When surrogate relationships vary across treatment classes, such validation may fail due to limited data within each treatment class. In this paper, two alternative Bayesian meta-analytic methods are introduced which allow for borrowing of information from other treatment classes when exploring the surrogacy in a particular class. The first approach extends a standard model for the evaluation of surrogate endpoints to a hierarchical meta-analysis model assuming full exchangeability of surrogate relationships across all the treatment classes, thus facilitating borrowing of information across the classes. The second method is able to relax this assumption by allowing for partial exchangeability of surrogate relationships across treatment classes to avoid excessive borrowing of information from distinctly different classes. We carried out a simulation study to assess the proposed methods in nine data scenarios and compared them with subgroup analysis using the standard model within each treatment class. We also applied the methods to an illustrative example in colorectal cancer which led to obtaining the parameters describing the surrogate relationships with higher precision.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

abstract = {In health technology assessment, decisions are based on complex cost-effectiveness models that require numerous input parameters. When not all relevant estimates are available, the model may have to be simplified. Multiparameter evidence synthesis combines data from diverse sources of evidence, which results in obtaining estimates required in clinical decision making that otherwise may not be available. We demonstrate how bivariate meta-analysis can be used to predict an unreported estimate of a treatment effect enabling implementation of a multistate Markov model, which otherwise needs to be simplified. To illustrate this, we used an example of cost-effectiveness analysis for docetaxel in combination with prednisolone in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Bivariate meta-analysis was used to model jointly available data on treatment effects on overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) to predict the unreported effect on PFS in a study evaluating docetaxel with prednisolone. The predicted treatment effect on PFS enabled implementation of a 3-state Markov model comprising stable disease, progressive disease, and dead states, while lack of the estimate restricted the model to a 2-state model (with alive and dead states). The 2-state and 3-state models were compared by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (which was much lower in the 3-state model: {\pounds}22,148 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared to {\pounds}30,026 obtained from the 2-state model) and the expected value of perfect information (which increased with the 3-state model). The 3-state model has the advantage of distinguishing surviving patients who progressed from those who did not progress. Hence, the use of advanced meta-analytic techniques allowed obtaining relevant parameter estimates to populate a model describing disease pathway in more detail while helping to prevent valuable clinical data from being discarded.},

abstract = {Expert opinion and judgment enter into the practice of statistical inference and decision-making in numerous ways. Indeed, there is essentially no aspect of scientific investigation in which judgment is not required. Judgment is necessarily subjective, but should be made as carefully, as objectively, and as scientifically as possible. Elicitation of expert knowledge concerning an uncertain quantity expresses that knowledge in the form of a (subjective) probability distribution for the quantity. Such distributions play an important role in statistical inference (for example as prior distributions in a Bayesian analysis) and in evidence-based decision-making (for example as expressions of uncertainty regarding inputs to a decision model). This article sets out a number of practices through which elicitation can be made as rigorous and scientific as possible. One such practice is to follow a recognized protocol that is designed to address and minimize the cognitive biases that experts are prone to when making probabilistic judgments. We review the leading protocols in the field, and contrast their different approaches to dealing with these biases through the medium of a detailed case study employing the SHELF protocol. The article ends with discussion of how to elicit a joint probability distribution for multiple uncertain quantities, which is a challenge for all the leading protocols.

@article{Bullement2020,
abstract = {Background: Due to limited duration of follow up in clinical trials of cancer treatments, estimates of lifetime survival benefits are typically derived using statistical extrapolation methods. To justify the method used, a range of approaches have been proposed including statistical goodness-of-fit tests and comparing estimates against a previous data cut (i.e. interim data collected). In this study, we extend these approaches by presenting a range of extrapolations fitted to four pre-planned data cuts from the JAVELIN Merkel 200 (JM200) trial. By comparing different estimates of survival and goodness-of-fit as JM200 data mature, we undertook an iterative process of fitting and re-fitting survival models to retrospectively identify early indications of likely long-term survival. Methods: Standard and spline-based parametric models were fitted to overall survival data from each JM200 data cut. Goodness-of-fit was determined using an assessment of the estimated hazard function, information theory-based methods and objective comparisons of estimation accuracy. Best-fitting extrapolations were compared to establish which one provided the most accurate estimation, and how statistical goodness-of-fit differed. Results: Spline-based models provided the closest fit to the final JM200 data cut, though all extrapolation methods based on the earliest data cut underestimated the 'true' long-term survival (difference in restricted mean survival time [RMST] at 36 months:-1.1 to-0.5 months). Goodness-of-fit scores illustrated that an increasingly flexible model was favored as data matured. Given an early data cut, a more flexible model better aligned with clinical expectations could be reasonably justified using a range of metrics, including RMST and goodness-of-fit scores (which were typically within a 2-point range of the statistically 'best-fitting' model). Conclusions: Survival estimates from the spline-based models are more aligned with clinical expectation and provided a better fit to the JM200 data, despite not exhibiting the definitively 'best' statistical goodness-of-fit. Longer-term data are required to further validate extrapolations, though this study illustrates the importance of clinical plausibility when selecting the most appropriate model. In addition, hazard-based plots and goodness-of-fit tests from multiple data cuts present useful approaches to identify when a more flexible model may be advantageous. Trial registration: JAVELIN Merkel 200 was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02155647 on June 4, 2014.},

abstract = {Background: Standard parametric survival models are commonly used to estimate long-term survival in oncology health technology assessments; however, they can inadequately represent the complex pattern of hazard functions or underlying mechanism of action (MoA) of immuno-oncology (IO) treatments. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore methods for extrapolating overall survival (OS) and provide insights on model selection in the context of the underlying MoA of IO treatments. Methods: Standard parametric, flexible parametric, cure, parametric mixture and landmark models were applied to data from ATLANTIC (NCT02087423; data cut-off [DCO] 3 June 2016). The goodness of fit of each model was compared using the observed survival and hazard functions, together with the plausibility of corresponding model extrapolation beyond the trial period. Extrapolations were compared with updated data from ATLANTIC (DCO 7 November 2017) for validation. Results: A close fit to the observed OS was seen with all models; however, projections beyond the trial period differed. Estimated mean OS differed substantially across models. The cure models provided the best fit for the new DCO. Conclusions: Standard parametric models fitted to the initial ATLANTIC DCO generally underestimated longer-term OS, compared with the later DCO. Cure, parametric mixture and response-based landmark models predicted that larger proportions of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer receiving IO treatments may experience long-term survival, which was more in keeping with the observed data. Further research using more mature OS data for IO treatments is needed.},

abstract = {The immune system employs several checkpoint pathways to regulate responses, maintain homeostasis and prevent self-reactivity and autoimmunity. Tumor cells can hijack these protective mechanisms to enable immune escape, cancer survival and proliferation. Blocking antibodies, designed to interfere with checkpoint molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 and counteract these immune suppressive mechanisms, have shown significant success in promoting immune responses against cancer and can result in tumor regression in many patients. While inhibitors to CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are well-established for the clinical management of melanoma, many patients do not respond or develop resistance to these interventions. Concerted efforts have focused on combinations of approved therapies aiming to further augment positive outcomes and survival. While CTLA-4 and PD-1 are the most-extensively researched targets, results from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials indicate that novel agents, specific for checkpoints such as A2AR, LAG-3, IDO and others, may further contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes, most likely in combinations with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 blockade. This review discusses the rationale for, and results to date of, the development of inhibitory immune checkpoint blockade combination therapies in melanoma. The clinical potential of new pipeline therapeutics, and possible future therapy design and directions that hold promise to significantly improve clinical prognosis compared with monotherapy, are discussed.},

abstract = {Survival data can contain an unknown fraction of subjects who are "cured" in the sense of not being at risk of failure. We describe such data with cure-mixture models, which separately model cure status and the hazard of failure among non-cured subjects. No diagnostic currently exists for evaluating the fit of such models; the popular Schoenfeld residual (Schoenfeld, 1982. Partial residuals for the proportional hazards regression-model. Biometrika 69, 239-241) is not applicable to data with cures. In this article, we propose a pseudo-residual, modeled on Schoenfeld's, to assess the fit of the survival regression in the non-cured fraction. Unlike Schoenfeld's approach, which tests the validity of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption, our method uses the full hazard and is thus also applicable to non-PH models. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the residuals and evaluate their performance by simulation in a range of parametric models. We apply our approach to data from a smoking cessation drug trial. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Nivolumab with ipilimumab (the Regimen) is the first immuno-oncology combination treatment to demonstrate long-term clinical benefit for advanced melanoma patients. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of the Regimen in this population, with and without the availability of overall survival (OS) data. Methods: A partitioned survival model and a Markov state-transition model were developed to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of the Regimen versus ipilimumab. These models were built with and without the availability of OS data, as only progression-free survival data were available from the head-to-head, phase III trial against ipilimumab at the time of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) submission. Patient utilities and resource use data were sourced from trial data or the literature. Results: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and absolute costs were similar between the models with and without OS data, but the model with OS data generated more than 1 additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across both treatment arms. In both models, based on list prices, the Regimen was the most cost-effective treatment. Conclusions: The analyses show that the Regimen is a cost-effective treatment for advanced melanoma patients in England, and methods to overcome the lack of OS can give reasonable estimates of QALYs gained and ICERs.},

abstract = {Background: Previously reported results from the phase 3 CheckMate 067 trial showed a significant improvement in objective responses, progression-free survival, and overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone compared with ipilimumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma. The aim of this report is to provide 4-year updated efficacy and safety data from this study. Methods: In this phase 3 trial, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, unresectable, stage III or stage IV melanoma, known BRAFV600 mutation status, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive intravenous nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus placebo, or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses plus placebo. Randomisation was done via an interactive voice response system with a permuted block schedule (block size of six) and stratification by PD-L1 status, BRAF mutation status, and metastasis stage. The patients, investigators, study site staff, and study funder were masked to the study drug administered. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population, whereas safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The results presented in this report reflect the 4-year update of the ongoing study with a database lock date of May 10, 2018. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01844505. Findings: Between July 3, 2013, and March 31, 2014, 945 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=314), nivolumab (n=316), or ipilimumab (n=315). Median follow-up was 46{\textperiodcentered}9 months (IQR 10{\textperiodcentered}9–51{\textperiodcentered}8) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, 36{\textperiodcentered}0 months (10{\textperiodcentered}5–51{\textperiodcentered}4) in the nivolumab group, and 18{\textperiodcentered}6 months (7{\textperiodcentered}6–49{\textperiodcentered}5) in the ipilimumab group. At a minimum follow-up of 48 months from the date that the final patient was enrolled and randomised, median overall survival was not reached (95\% CI 38{\textperiodcentered}2–not reached) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, 36{\textperiodcentered}9 months (28{\textperiodcentered}3–not reached) in the nivolumab group, and 19{\textperiodcentered}9 months (16{\textperiodcentered}9–24{\textperiodcentered}6) in the ipilimumab group. The hazard ratio for death for the combination versus ipilimumab was 0{\textperiodcentered}54 (95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}44–0{\textperiodcentered}67; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and for nivolumab versus ipilimumab was 0{\textperiodcentered}65 (0{\textperiodcentered}53–0{\textperiodcentered}79; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Median progression-free survival was 11{\textperiodcentered}5 months (95\% CI 8{\textperiodcentered}7–19{\textperiodcentered}3) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, 6{\textperiodcentered}9 months (5{\textperiodcentered}1–10{\textperiodcentered}2) in the nivolumab group, and 2{\textperiodcentered}9 months (2{\textperiodcentered}8–3{\textperiodcentered}2) in the ipilimumab group. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival for the combination versus ipilimumab was 0{\textperiodcentered}42 (95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}35–0{\textperiodcentered}51; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and for nivolumab versus ipilimumab was 0{\textperiodcentered}53 (0{\textperiodcentered}44–0{\textperiodcentered}64; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Treatment-related grade 3–4 adverse events were reported in 185 (59\%) of 313 patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 70 (22\%) of 313 who received nivolumab, and 86 (28\%) of 311 who received ipilimumab. The most common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were diarrhoea in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (29 [9\%] of 313) and in the nivolumab group (nine [3\%] of 313) and colitis in the ipilimumab group (23 [7\%] of 311); the most common grade 4 adverse event in all three groups was increased lipase (15 [5\%] of 313 in the combination group, ten [3\%] of 313 in the nivolumab group, and four [1\%] of 311 in the ipilimumab group). Serious adverse events were not analysed for the 4-year follow-up. In total for the study, there were four treatment-related deaths: two in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (one cardiomyopathy and one liver necrosis), one in the nivolumab group (neutropenia), and one in the ipilimumab group (colon perforation). No additional treatment-related deaths have occurred since the previous (3-year) analysis. Interpretation: The results of this analysis at 4 years of follow-up show that a durable, sustained survival benefit can be achieved with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma.

@article{Heath2017,
abstract = {In recent years, value-of-information analysis has become more widespread in health economic evaluations, specifically as a tool to guide further research and perform probabilistic sensitivity analysis. This is partly due to methodological advancements allowing for the fast computation of a typical summary known as the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI). A recent review discussed some approximation methods for calculating the EVPPI, but as the research has been active over the intervening years, that review does not discuss some key estimation methods. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive review of these new methods. We begin by providing the technical details of these computation methods. We then present two case studies in order to compare the estimation performance of these new methods. We conclude that a method based on nonparametric regression offers the best method for calculating the EVPPI in terms of accuracy, computational time, and ease of implementation. This means that the EVPPI can now be used practically in health economic evaluations, especially as all the methods are developed in parallel with R functions and a web app to aid practitioners.},

abstract = {This article describes methods used to estimate parameters governing long-term survival, or times to other events, for health economic models. Specifically, the focus is on methods that combine shorter-term individual-level survival data from randomized trials with longer-term external data, thus using the longer-term data to aid extrapolation of the short-term data. This requires assumptions about how trends in survival for each treatment arm will continue after the follow-up period of the trial. Furthermore, using external data requires assumptions about how survival differs between the populations represented by the trial and external data. Study reports from a national health technology assessment program in the United Kingdom were searched, and the findings were combined with "pearl-growing" searches of the academic literature. We categorized the methods that have been used according to the assumptions they made about how the hazards of death vary between the external and internal data and through time, and we discuss the appropriateness of the assumptions in different circumstances. Modeling choices, parameter estimation, and characterization of uncertainty are discussed, and some suggestions for future research priorities in this area are given.},

abstract = {Background Survival extrapolation is essential in the cost-effectiveness analysis to quantify the lifetime survival benefit associated with a new intervention, due to the restricted duration of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Current approaches of extrapolation often assume that the treatment effect observed in the trial can continue indefinitely, which is unrealistic and may have a huge impact on decisions for resource allocation. Objective We introduce a novel methodology as a possible solution to alleviate the problem of performing survival extrapolation with heavily censored data from clinical trials. Method The main idea is to mix a flexible model (e.g., Cox semi-parametric) to fit as well as possible the observed data and a parametric model encoding assumptions on the expected behaviour of underlying long-term survival. The two are "blended" into a single survival curve that is identical with the Cox model over the range of observed times and gradually approaching the parametric model over the extrapolation period based on a weight function. The weight function regulates the way two survival curves are blended, determining how the internal and external sources contribute to the estimated survival over time. Results A 4-year follow-up RCT of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide v. fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is used to illustrate the method. Conclusion Long-term extrapolation from immature trial data may lead to significantly different estimates with various modelling assumptions. The blending approach provides sufficient flexibility, allowing a wide range of plausible scenarios to be considered as well as the inclusion of genuine external information, based e.g. on hard data or expert opinion. Both internal and external validity can be carefully examined.},
